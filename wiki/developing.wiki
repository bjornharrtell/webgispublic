#summary How to develop with WebGIS Public API

== General information ==

You need to know how AJAX and object oriented javascript works. You also need to learn [Ext Ext JS] and OpenLayers API, at least at a basic level. [Ext Ext JS] has a great resource on the subject general [http://extjs.com/learn/Manual:Resources Web 2.0 developing] and also quite a few good tutorials on how to use the [Ext Ext JS] framework itself.

If you do not need to make new tools or OpenLayers extensions aside from the included ones in WebGIS, I would suggest that you focus on learning basic usage of [Ext Ext JS] to be able to do some GUI layouts using WebGIS controls.

A test project is included with the source that should provide a basis for new projects and further development.

Comments in code are in JSDoc format and documentation can be built with a release.

== Basic HTML page include example ==

Inclusion of the API in a HTML page is similar to [Ext Ext JS]. One CSS file and one Javascript file is referenced. Ext JS and OpenLayers should be included first. Example:

{{{
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ext-2.1/resources/css/ext-all.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="ext-2.1/ext-all.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="OpenLayers-2.6/OpenLayers.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="webgis/resources/css/webgis.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="webgis/webgis.js"></script>
}}}

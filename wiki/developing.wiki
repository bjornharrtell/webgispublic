#summary How to develop with WebGIS Public API

You need to know how AJAX and object oriented javascript works. You also need to learn Ext JS and !OpenLayers API, at least at a basic level. Ext JS has a great resource on the subject general [http://extjs.com/learn/Manual:Resources Web 2.0 developing] and also quite a few good tutorials on how to use the Ext JS framework itself.

If you do not need to make new tools or !OpenLayers extensions aside from the included ones in WebGIS, I would suggest that you focus on learning basic usage of Ext JS to be able to do some GUI layouts using WebGIS controls.

A test project is included with the source that should provide a basis for new projects and further development.

Comments in code are in JSDoc format and documentation can be built with a release.
